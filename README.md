# mapleDocs
System for managing machine readable data management plans (maDMPs) created for Data Stewardship course at TU Vienna

With mapleDocs users can upload their maDMPs, they are then stored in a MongoDB and can be searched very efficiently with
the help of Elasticsearch. Furthermore the application is fully containerized with Docker.
